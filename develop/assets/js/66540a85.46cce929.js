On the other hand, if we don't allow the seller to increase the price of the apples, then the seller is losing value by providing apples to the market and has more incentive to just hold on to his apples. Similarly, the AMM increases or decreases the price of an asset to protect the LP in case of mass buy or sell events in the market.

Ethereum-like blockchains prioritise transactions with higher gas fees. As blockchain is transparent anyone in the network can see other transactions in the queue.
